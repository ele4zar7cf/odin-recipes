    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>These baked scrambled eggs are light and fluffy and are a snap to put together for a big crowd. I usually make two pans for our Christmas brunch, and I never have many leftovers!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
        <li>24 eggs</li>
        <li>2 1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Pour melted butter into a 9x13-inch glass baking dish.</li>
        <li>Whisk together eggs and salt in a large bowl until well-blended. Gradually whisk in milk. Pour egg mixture into the buttered dish.</li>
        <li>Bake uncovered in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Stir egg mixture and continue to bake until eggs are set, 10 to 15 minutes more.</li>
    </ol>
