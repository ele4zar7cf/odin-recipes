    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This strawberry spinach salad is a great way to get kids to eat spinach! Someone brought this salad to a potluck dinner, and I had to have the recipe. Since then, I've made it many times and I've been asked for the recipe every time I take it somewhere</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 quart strawberries - cleaned, hulled and sliced</li>
        <li>10 ounces fresh spinach - rinsed, dried and torn into bite-size pieces</li>
        <li>1/4 cup almonds, blanched and slivered</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make dressing: Whisk together sugar, oil, vinegar, sesame seeds, poppy seeds, onion, paprika, and Worcestershire in a medium bowl. Cover and chill for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Make salad: Combine strawberries, spinach, and almonds in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Pour dressing over salad; toss to coat. Refrigerate for 10 to 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
